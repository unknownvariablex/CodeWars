//Write a function that takes in a string of one or more words, and returns the same string, but with all words that have five or more letters reversed (Just like the name of this Kata). Strings passed in will consist of only letters and spaces. Spaces will be included only when more than one word is present.

//Examples:

//"Hey fellow warriors"  --> "Hey wollef sroirraw" 
//"This is a test        --> "This is a test" 
//"This is another test" --> "This is rehtona test"

function spinWords(string){
  //Make an array with words from the string
  const words = string.split(" ")
  //Make new array that checks word length and reverses the words that are 5 or more characters long. We will use the map function to do this so 
  //we don't have to worry about iterating over all the words in the array. 
  const reversedWords = words.map((word) => {
    if (word.length >= 5){ 
      //this takes the word, splits it into an array of characters, reverses that array, and joins it back into a string
      return word.split("").reverse().join("")
    }
    //leave short words alone
    return word   
  }) 
  //take the changed words in the new array and joins them back into a single string and returns
  return reversedWords.join(" ")
}
